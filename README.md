# Dp-Cypher-Solver
All files in here need cipher.py to run except from cipher.py
# Important(ish)
The vignere decrypt option is broken (lol) use my other project called 'VIGNERE BRUTE FORCE PROGRAM' or something like that if you need to run it.
# How to run
To run any of the scripts just download them and cipher.py then open them in you OS.
It should not error at all because I have debugged the files.
# Releases
The releases are available at https://github.com/djpiper28/Dp-Cypher-Solver/releases to download and use freely.
Release naming scheme is in the form 'major.minor-[general or dev]' e.g: 1.0-general.
